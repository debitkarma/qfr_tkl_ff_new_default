# New Default Layout for CoolerMaster Quickfire Rapid + Frosty Flake (2014) TKL

QMK's default layout for the Frosty Flake is lacking some of the basic functionality that the CoolerMaster QuickFire Rapid has in place by default - namely, the media functions and WinLock key.

This is aimed at being a new layout that should serve as a basic jumping off point.

This is for the Tenkey-less version of the keyboard.

I also plan on adding a new keymap that adds macro functionality for this entire keyboard.
